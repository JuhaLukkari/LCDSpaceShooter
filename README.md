# LCDSpaceShooter
Arduino program (and sketch) for controlling a 16x2 LCD screen to produce an old school type of space shooter. A spacecraft can be controlled on the screen with two switches. Some bugs are there, but has a basic functionality. Enemies spawn periodically, they can be shot and destroyed, player can move up & down on LCD, loop restarts if player dies, etc.
